## Project Title
Data Analysis Using Machine Learning Methods: Palmer Penguins Dataset

## Description
Objective: To predict the penguins' species from other variables.

Results: By applying decision tree algorithm and logistic regression algorithm, it is found that decision tree is more likely to lead to overfitting.

Conclusion: Logistic regression is more suitable for this dataset.

## Dataset being used
The Palmer Penguins Dataset

## Performance parameters used
Accuracy is used to measure model's effectiveness. Train score and test score are compared to show evidence of overfitting.
